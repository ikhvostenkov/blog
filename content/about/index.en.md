Hey! My name’s Igor Khvostenkov.

I like to solve complicated technical challenges and learn new things. I would like to share
my experience with you, as information is learned when you can explain it to someone else.
Writing/Blogging is a simple way of approaching anything new you want to learn. That's why I
started this blog.

I [write](https://github.com/ikhvostenkov)
mostly in Java and Kotlin, but also in Python, GO, and JavaScript.

Currently, I am really into AWS and IoT, as I work at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) on IoT projects.
So primarily I will blog about this. WebRTC is also in my focus of interest as I was working on
[GoToMeeting](https://www.goto.com/meeting) in the past, be prepared to see posts on WebRTC as well.

I’ve got one simple goal to improve my engineering skills, and I invite you to join me on this way!

***Let’s Code!***
